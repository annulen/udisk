A simple wrapper script for udisksctl.

Usage:
    `udisk status` - prints actual mountable devices instead of just "sda", "sdb", etc.
    `udisk mount /dev/sda1` - does the same as `udisksctl mount -b /dev/sda1`
    `udisk umount /dev/sda1` - does the same as `udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sda1`
                               (but with `umount` instead of `unmount`)
