Manual device mounting made easy.

This is a wrapper script for `udisksctl` making it more convenient to use.

Usage:
    `udisk` (or `udisk status`) - prints actual mountable devices instead of just "sda", "sdb", etc.
    `udisk wait`                - waits for new device to appear then prints status
    `udisk mount /dev/sda1`     - does the same as `udisksctl mount -b /dev/sda1`
    `udisk umount /dev/sda1`    - does the same as `udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sda1`
                                  (but with `umount` instead of `unmount`)

Example of status output:


Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 500GB   /dev/nvme0n1
                                 /dev/nvme0n1p1        /boot/efi
                                 /dev/nvme0n1p2        /
WDC WD40EFAX-68JH4N1             /dev/sda
Kingston DataTraveler 160        /dev/sdb
                                 /dev/sdb1        Not mounted
                                 /dev/sdb2        /media/ktokarev/DISK2S2
                                 /dev/sdb4        Not mounted
